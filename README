====================================

An iPhone app that lets you look Instagram photos that you´ve liked.

It was made with iOS SDK 4.x, but it works on 5.0 too. It uses Instagram´s official API to retrieve the user´s likes, It authenticates with OAuth, it uses a url redirection across Safari mobile app and Instalike app, a la Facebook Single sign-on.
